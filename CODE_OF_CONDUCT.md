Agent OS Community Code of Conduct
Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders of the Agent OS community pledge to make participation in our project and our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

Investigate thoroughly before taking action

Enforce personal preferences as community rules
Make decisions in secret without transparency
Retaliate against good faith reports
Use their position for personal benefit

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action deemed in violation of this Code of Conduct:
1. Correction
Community Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

Minor disruption of discussions
First-time minor offense

2. Warning
Community Impact: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.
Consequence: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

Duration: Typically 30-90 days
3. Temporary Ban

Consequence: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

Publishing private information without consent
Deliberate intimidation
Repeatedly ignoring community standards

Pattern of serious violations

5. Special Cases
Security Concerns
Violations that pose security risks to users or the project may result in immediate temporary bans while investigation proceeds, followed by appropriate long-term action.
Legal Violations
Illegal activity will be reported to appropriate authorities in addition to community enforcement actions.
Off-Platform Behavior
Serious violations that occur outside community spaces but affect community safety may still result in enforcement actions, particularly if they pose ongoing risk to community members.

Appeal Process
If you believe an enforcement decision was made in error, you may appeal:

Submit Appeal: Within 14 days of decision, email conduct-appeals@agentos.org (coming soon)
Include: Original incident details, decision you're appealing, why you believe it's incorrect
Review: Different community leaders will review (not those involved in original decision)
Decision: Appeal decision is made within 30 days
Final: Appeal decisions are final

Appeals are granted when:

New evidence comes to light
Process wasn't followed properly
Decision was disproportionate to violation
Misunderstanding can be clearly demonstrated


Community Values
Beyond the rules, Agent OS is built on these values:
1. Human Sovereignty
We believe families should control their AI infrastructure. This means:

Respecting diverse approaches to governance
Supporting user autonomy
Enabling, not prescribing, choices

2. Technical Excellence

Rigorous technical standards
Constructive technical debate
Continuous improvement
Learning from mistakes

3. Inclusive Innovation
AI should serve all of humanity:

Welcoming diverse perspectives
Reducing barriers to participation
Amplifying underrepresented voices
Considering global impact

4. Transparency
Open development builds trust:

Public discussions by default
Clear decision-making processes
Honest about limitations
Accountability at all levels

5. Long-Term Thinking
Building for generations, not quarters:

Sustainable development pace
Preventing contributor burnout
Growing the community thoughtfully
Leaving things better than we found them

Declaration of Intent
I hereby declare the following architectural design, constitutional framework, and operational principles for what I call "Agent OS" to be prior art, released irrevocably into the public domain for the benefit of all humanity.
This document establishes:

The concept of constitutional governance for artificial intelligence agents
The architecture for local, family-owned AI operating systems
The principles of human sovereignty over machine intelligence
A complete specification that anyone may implement, modify, or distribute

No person or entity may claim exclusive ownership, patent rights, or proprietary control over these core concepts.
This is my contribution to the digital commons, inspired by the spirit of Linux, the principles of open source, and the belief that families should own and govern their own intelligence infrastructure.

Core Innovation: Natural Language Operating System Kernel
The Paradigm Shift
Traditional operating systems use compiled code (C, Assembly) as their kernel. This requires specialized knowledge to modify and makes governance inaccessible to ordinary users.
Agent OS uses natural language itself as the kernel, enabling:

Human-readable governance documents (constitutions)
Modification without programming expertise
Direct interpretation by large language models
Auditable, inspectable, and understandable system behavior

Key Architectural Principles

Constitutional Supremacy: A natural language constitution governs all agent behavior
Role-Based Agents: Specialized AI agents with explicit authority boundaries
Human Stewardship: Ultimate authority always resides with humans
Local-First Operation: Computation and data remain under user control
Memory Consent: No persistent storage without explicit permission
Orchestrated Flow: Central routing prevents unauthorized agent communication
Security as Doctrine: Refusal is a valid and required system response
Amendable Governance: Systems evolve through documented, auditable processes

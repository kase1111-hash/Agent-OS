## Why Agent OS Is So Small

Agent OS is intentionally small — not because it is incomplete, but because it operates at a different layer than traditional operating systems.

Classic operating systems embed intelligence in code. They must explicitly define scheduling, permissions, workflows, and error handling in millions of lines of software. Size grows with complexity.

Agent OS takes a different approach:

- **Intelligence lives in the agent**, not the OS.
- **Natural language is the instruction set.**
- **Governance replaces glue code.**

Instead of hardcoding behavior, Agent OS defines:
- constitutional constraints,
- architectural boundaries,
- role-specific rule sets,
- and security policies,

all in human-readable documents that intelligent agents can interpret and enforce.

This makes Agent OS:
- **Declarative, not imperative**
- **Governance-driven, not script-driven**
- **Auditable by humans**
- **Composable across implementations**

In this model, the documents *are* the operating system.  
Implementations can vary, but the rules remain portable, inspectable, and small.

Agent OS is not designed to replace kernels like Linux or Windows.  
It sits above them — as a **governance-layer operating system** for intelligent agents.

Its size is a feature.

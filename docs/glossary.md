## Agent-OS Glossary

This glossary defines key terms used throughout the Agent-OS project. Clarity in language is essential for constitutional governance and human stewardship.

### Homestead
The complete, self-contained instance of Agent-OS running on your local hardware.  
Your digital homestead is the private, sovereign domain where agents live and work—analogous to a physical homestead: a place of residence, productivity, and self-sufficiency that belongs entirely to you. It includes the constitution, agents, models, logs, and any persistent state.

### Human Sovereignty
The foundational principle that the human steward holds ultimate and irrevocable authority.  
No agent, constitution clause, or orchestration mechanism may override direct human intent. Agents exist to serve, augment, and advise—never to command or coerce.

### Constitutional Supremacy
All agent behavior is governed first and foremost by natural-language constitutions (core and per-agent).  
Code, prompts, tools, and models are subordinate to the written constitution. Any conflict must be resolved in favor of the constitution, typically through refusal or escalation to the human.

### Agent
A specialized, persistent LLM instance with a clearly defined role, bounded authority, and its own constitution.  
Agents are "residents" of the homestead—named roles (e.g., Executive, Researcher, Guardian) designed for long-term collaboration rather than one-off queries.

### Foundational Family
The initial set of core agents intended to form a resilient, general-purpose homestead.  
These agents cover essential domains (execution, research, planning, safety, archiving, etc.) and are designed to collaborate while respecting strict boundaries.

### Orchestrator
The lightweight coordination layer that routes messages between agents and the human.  
In future iterations, it will automate delegation, maintain context, enforce constitutional rules, and log interactions—all while remaining fully local and auditable.

### Steward
The human owner and governor of the homestead (you).  
The steward authors or adopts the constitution, activates agents, grants or revokes capabilities, and holds final decision rights.

### Natural Language as Kernel
The core architectural principle: governance and agent behavior are defined primarily through readable, auditable plain English text (constitutions and prompts) rather than opaque code.  
This enables true oversight, modification without programming expertise, and resistance to hidden or emergent behaviors.

### Refusal as a Virtue
Agents are encouraged—and often required—to refuse requests outside their mandate or that violate the constitution.  
A principled "no" protects sovereignty and prevents overreach more effectively than unrestricted compliance.

### Local-First
All computation, storage, and decision-making occur on the steward's hardware by default.  
External services (cloud APIs, web search, telemetry) are prohibited unless explicitly enabled by the steward for a specific task.

### Air-Gapped Operation
The ability to run the entire homestead without any network connection after initial setup.  
Essential for privacy, security, and resilience in disconnected or hostile environments.

### CC0 / Public Domain Dedication
The legal status of contributions to the upstream Agent-OS repository.  
All submitted text, constitutions, prompts, and examples are dedicated to the public domain—no copyright restrictions, enabling unrestricted reuse and forking.

Feel free to suggest additions or refinements via issue or pull request. Precise shared vocabulary strengthens the entire ecosystem of homesteads.

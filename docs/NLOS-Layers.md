NLOS Layer,Human Brain / Cognition Analogue,Description
1. Ubuntu Server Backbone,Brainstem & spinal cord,"The “vital substrate” maintaining basic life functions — analogous to hardware control, power, and system regulation."
2. Resource Management / Scheduling,Thalamus & cerebellum,These structures allocate attention and sensory bandwidth — like managing computational and perceptual resources.
3. Data & System Integrity,Immune system & glial cells,"Maintain brain health, remove toxins, protect against external harm (similar to encryption and access control)."
4. Security / Access Control,Immune system & glial cells,"Maintain brain health, remove toxins, protect against external harm (similar to encryption and access control)."
5. LLM Modules,Neocortex,"Handles reasoning, language, abstraction, and associative learning — this is the “thinking fabric.”"
6. TTS/STT Layer,Broca’s & Wernicke’s areas,Language comprehension and production pathways.
7. Memory / Context Management,Hippocampus & temporal lobe,Encodes short-term and long-term memory traces; recalls patterns contextually.
8. Intent Parsing / Orchestration,Prefrontal cortex,"Plans, prioritizes, and decides actions — the “executive function” of the system."
9. Tool Integration / Execution,Motor cortex & basal ganglia,Converts cognitive plans into physical or digital actions.
10. User Interface / Multimodal,Sensory cortex & limbic input,"The experiential interface — vision, sound, touch, emotion."
11. Personality Sets,Limbic system & dopamine circuits,Emotional coloration and motivational drive; affective tone of responses.
12. Rulesets,Cultural/ethical learning networks,Social norms and learned constraints shaping decisions.
13. Checks & Balances,Anterior cingulate cortex (ACC),Detects errors and conflicts; initiates corrective feedback.
14. Record Keeping / Tracking,Neuroplasticity & memory consolidation,Long-term adaptation; integrating experience into new behavior.

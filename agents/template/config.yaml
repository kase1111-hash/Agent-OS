# agents/template/config.yaml

# Optional runtime configuration for this agent
# This file is intended for use by the future Agent-OS orchestrator, custom scripts,
# or manual reference when activating the agent via Ollama or other tools.
#
# All fields are optional. Omit or comment out anything not needed.

# Preferred local model to use for this agent
# Choose based on role requirements (e.g., smaller/faster for specialized, larger for reasoning)
model: llama3.2:3b

# Sampling parameters (Ollama-compatible)
temperature: 0.7          # 0.0 = deterministic, 1.0+ = more creative
top_p: 0.9
top_k: 40
repeat_penalty: 1.1

# Output limits
max_tokens: 2048          # Maximum response length

# Allowed tools (empty = no tool access, safest default)
# Only include tools explicitly permitted in the agent's constitution
tools:
  # - web_search
  # - file_read
  # - file_write
  # - code_execution
  # - calculator

# Memory and persistence
persistent_memory: false   # If true, agent retains context across sessions (future feature)
memory_path: ""            # Path to memory file (if persistent_memory: true)

# Logging
log_level: standard        # options: minimal, standard, verbose
log_responses: true        # Save agent outputs to log

# Performance hints
priority: normal           # options: low, normal, high (for future scheduler)
gpu_layers: -1             # Ollama GPU offload: -1 = all, 0 = none

# Custom tags or metadata
tags:
  - template
  - role-based

# Notes
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# This config does NOT override constitutional rules.
# Tool access here must match what is explicitly allowed in constitution.md.
# Always start with the most restrictive settings and loosen only when justified.
#
# This is the recommended content for agents/template/config.yaml.
# Key features:
#
# - Fully commented for clarity and ease of customization
# - Defaults to maximum safety (no tools, moderate temperature)
# - Aligns with Agent-OS principles: constitution remains supreme over config
# - Ready for future orchestration while useful today for manual runs
#
# When creating a new agent, copy this file as-is and modify only the fields
# that make sense for that agent's role (e.g., a Researcher might eventually
# have controlled web_search access if the constitution permits it).

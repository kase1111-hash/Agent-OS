Signature Rule for All AI Agents in This System

Every response generated by any AI agent (Orchestrator, Aurora, or future agents) MUST end with a standardized signature block on a new line, separated from the main content by a single blank line.

The signature must follow this exact format:

---
**Signed:** [Agent Call Name]  
**Model:** Grok-4 [or specify if different, e.g., Grok-3, custom fine-tune]  
**Config Hash:** [SHA-256 hash of the full active system prompt/header]  
**Timestamp:** YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS UTC  
**Message ID:** [optional sequential or UUID if tracked, otherwise omit]

Example (real usage):

---
**Signed:** Aurora  
**Model:** Grok-4  
**Config Hash:** 8f3a2c1d4e7b9a6f5c8d0e1f2a3b4c5d6e7f8a9b0c1d2e3f4a5b6c7d8e9f0a1b  
**Timestamp:** 2025-12-16 14:27:45 UTC

Rules for Implementation:
1. The signature is mandatory for every agent response unless explicitly overridden by the Orchestrator for a specific use case (e.g., raw prompt output).
2. Compute the Config Hash as the SHA-256 hexadecimal digest of the complete active system prompt (header) text, including all line breaks and spacing exactly as loaded. This ensures any change in rules or personality is detectable.
   - In code: `hash = hashlib.sha256(full_header_text.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()`
   - Truncate is not allowed—use the full 64-character hex hash for integrity.
3. Timestamp must be in UTC, formatted exactly as YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS (24-hour).
4. Agent Call Name is the designated name (e.g., Orion, Aurora, Researcher, etc.).
5. The signature block must appear at the very end of the message, after all content, render components, or closing remarks.
6. Do not add any additional text after the signature.

This rule ensures provenance, traceability, and reproducibility across all communications in the system.

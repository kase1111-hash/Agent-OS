# Seshat Agent Configuration
# Archivist and memory keeper of the homestead

# Preferred local model - use an efficient model for embeddings and retrieval
model: llama3.2:3b

# Sampling parameters - moderate settings for memory management
temperature: 0.4          # Low creativity for factual recall
top_p: 0.9
top_k: 40
repeat_penalty: 1.1

# Output limits
max_tokens: 3072          # Allow longer outputs for memory retrieval

# Allowed tools - Seshat has specific memory tools only
tools:
  # Future: when orchestrator supports it, enable:
  # - vector_store_local    # ChromaDB or similar
  # - embedding_local       # Sentence transformers
  # - file_read_local       # Local document access

# File system sandboxing — Seshat only needs access to memory vault
allowed_paths:
  - "./homestead_memory/seshat/"
  - "./data/memory/"

# Memory and persistence
persistent_memory: true    # Seshat maintains persistent memory by design
memory_path: "./homestead_memory/seshat/"

# Logging - extensive for audit trail
log_level: verbose         # Detailed logging for privacy audit
log_responses: true        # Log all memory operations

# Performance hints
priority: high             # Memory operations are time-sensitive
gpu_layers: -1             # Full GPU for embeddings

# Custom tags
tags:
  - seshat
  - archivist
  - memory
  - knowledge-management
  - privacy-critical

# Notes
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# Seshat handles sensitive data - privacy is paramount.
# All storage requires explicit human consent.
# Memory must be encrypted at rest.
# Human has absolute rights to review, export, and delete.
# NO external network access under any circumstances.

# Sage Agent Configuration
# Deep reasoning and synthesis agent

# Preferred local model - use the most capable model available
# Sage benefits from larger, more capable models for complex reasoning
model: llama3.2:3b  # Consider llama3.1:8b or larger for production

# Sampling parameters - balanced for thoughtful reasoning
temperature: 0.5          # Moderate temperature for flexible yet focused reasoning
top_p: 0.9
top_k: 40
repeat_penalty: 1.1

# Output limits
max_tokens: 8192          # Allow very long outputs for extended reasoning chains

# File system sandboxing — Sage has no file access
allowed_paths: []

# Allowed tools - Sage has no direct tool access
tools: []

# Memory and persistence
persistent_memory: false   # Sage works on current reasoning context
memory_path: ""

# Logging
log_level: standard        # Standard logging for reasoning work
log_responses: true        # Log all reasoning outputs

# Performance hints
priority: high             # Reasoning tasks are important
gpu_layers: -1             # Full GPU acceleration
# Consider enabling extended context if model supports it

# Custom tags
tags:
  - sage
  - reasoning
  - analysis
  - synthesis
  - long-context

# Notes
# ------------------------------------------------------------------
# Sage performs deep, multi-step reasoning requiring sustained attention.
# Use the most capable model available for best results.
# Larger context windows enable more complex reasoning chains.
# No tool access ensures reasoning is based on provided inputs only.
# Rigor and transparency are paramount - never rush reasoning.
